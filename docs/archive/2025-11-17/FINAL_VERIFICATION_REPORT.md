## CRITICAL ISSUE: MISSING $16.3M FROM EXTRACTION

**Problem:** My extraction totals $50,175,020 but PDF footer shows $66,520,603
**Missing:** $16,345,583

### Possible Causes:

1. **Multi-line entries not fully captured** - Some projects span multiple rows with subtotals
2. **Combined project codes** - Some projects have main + addendum that should be counted separately
3. **Page reading errors** - May have missed projects on certain pages
4. **Subtotal vs Grand Total confusion** - May have used subtotals instead of grand totals for multi-discipline projects

### Projects That Need Re-verification:

Based on the PDF structure, these are likely candidates for the missing amounts:

1. **22 BK-013** - Has multiple components (Phase 1 LA + ID + Monthly fees for Design Development)
   - May need to separate "22 BK-013" Phase 1 from "25 BK-013" monthly fees

2. **19 BK-018** - Three disciplines (LA, Arch, ID)
   - Currently combined as $1.9M, but may have extensions or addendums

3. **Wynn Projects** - Multiple venues with multiple project codes
   - May have additional 25 BK-039 or other addendums

4. **THB Currency Projects** - Projects invoiced in THB may have conversion issues
   - 19 BK-052 (Siam Hotel Chiangmai)
   - 24 BK-033 (Four Seasons)

## SQL CORRECTION SCRIPT

```sql
-- STEP 1: Update mismatched projects (PDF > DB)
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 1900000.00 WHERE project_code = '19 BK-018';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 4155000.00 WHERE project_code = '22 BK-013';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 3775000.00 WHERE project_code = '22 BK-095';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 250000.00 WHERE project_code = '25 BK-039';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 1797520.00 WHERE project_code = '23 BK-028';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 3250000.00 WHERE project_code = '23 BK-093';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 4650000.00 WHERE project_code = '23 BK-050';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 1450000.00 WHERE project_code = '24 BK-018';
UPDATE projects SET total_fee_usd = 125000.00 WHERE project_code = '25 BK-040';

-- STEP 2: Add missing projects
-- (Need to add client_id and other fields first)

-- STEP 3: Investigate DB > PDF cases
-- These projects show HIGHER amounts in DB than PDF:
-- 20 BK-047: DB=$834,078 vs PDF=$148,000 (Difference: -$686,078)
-- 24 BK-021: DB=$750,000 vs PDF=$345,000 (Difference: -$405,000)
```

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **✅ Run SQL correction script** to update the 9 mismatched projects where PDF > DB

2. **⚠️ INVESTIGATE** the 2 projects where DB > PDF:
   - 20 BK-047: Why is DB showing $834k when PDF shows only $148k?
   - 24 BK-021: Why is DB showing $750k when PDF shows only $345k?

3. **➕ ADD 4 missing projects** to the database:
   - 24 BK-033 ($1.5M)
   - 24 BK-058 ($2.99M)
   - 25 BK-015 ($300k)
   - 25 BK-017 ($3M)

4. **🔍 IDENTIFY MISSING $16.3M**:
   - Manually review all 11 pages of PDF
   - Check for projects with separate project codes that I combined
   - Verify all multi-discipline projects are correctly summed
   - Check if there are additional addendums or extensions

### LONG-TERM ACTIONS:

1. Create a standard "Project Status Report" template that clearly shows:
   - Project code
   - Total contract value
   - Work completed to date
   - Remaining work

2. Ensure database accurately reflects:
   - All addendums and extensions (separate project codes if needed)
   - Multi-discipline projects (separate or combined)
   - Current vs historical contract values

3. Regular reconciliation (monthly) between:
   - PDF status reports
   - Database records
   - Accounting system

## VERIFICATION STATUS

| Category | Count | Amount (PDF) | Amount (DB) | Status |
|----------|-------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| ✓ Matching | 15 | $21,039,500 | $21,039,500 | ✅ VERIFIED |
| ✗ Mismatched (PDF > DB) | 9 | $19,750,520 | $12,286,578 | 🔧 NEEDS UPDATE |
| ⚠️ Mismatched (DB > PDF) | 2 | $493,000 | $1,584,078 | ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION |
| ➕ Missing from DB | 4 | $7,790,000 | N/A | ➕ NEEDS ADDING |
| ❓ Unknown/Missing | ? | $16,345,583 | ? | 🔍 NEEDS IDENTIFICATION |
| **TOTAL** | **30+** | **$66,520,603** | **$195,710,078** | **⚠️ INCOMPLETE** |

---

## CONCLUSION

The verification reveals:

1. **15 projects match perfectly** between PDF and database
2. **9 projects need database updates** (PDF shows higher amounts)
3. **2 projects need investigation** (DB shows higher amounts - possible errors)
4. **4 projects missing from database** (need to be added)
5. **$16.3M unaccounted for** in my extraction (need to re-extract PDF completely)

**CRITICAL**: Before running any correction scripts, we MUST:
- Identify the missing $16.3M in projects
- Understand why 20 BK-047 shows $834k in DB but only $148k in PDF
- Understand why 24 BK-021 shows $750k in DB but only $345k in PDF

**This verification is INCOMPLETE until the $16.3M discrepancy is resolved.**
