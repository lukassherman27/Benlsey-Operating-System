# Archived Scripts

Deprecated or superseded scripts kept for reference.

## Why Archive?

Scripts are archived when:
- Replaced by better implementations
- One-time migration scripts (already run)
- Project-specific scripts no longer needed
- Experimental code that wasn't adopted

## Structure

- `deprecated/` - Old versions of active scripts
- `migrations/` - One-time data migration scripts
- `project_specific/` - Scripts for specific projects (Wynn, Art Deco, etc.)

## Before Deleting

Check these archived scripts if:
- You need to understand historical data transformations
- Debugging issues with old data
- Looking for implementation patterns

## Cleanup Policy

Scripts older than 6 months with no references may be deleted.
