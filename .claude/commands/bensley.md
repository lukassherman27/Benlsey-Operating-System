# Context Load

Read and summarize the 4 SSOT files to understand current system state.

## Instructions

1. Read these 4 files in order:
   - `.claude/STATUS.md` - Live numbers, what's working/broken, recent session work
   - `.claude/HANDOFF.md` - Business context, team info, data rules
   - `docs/roadmap.md` - Current phase, priorities, what's next
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design, database schema, services

2. After reading, provide a brief summary:
   - **Last Session:** What was done most recently
   - **Current Phase:** What phase we're in
   - **Live Numbers:** Key counts (emails, proposals, suggestions)
   - **What's Working:** Key systems that are operational
   - **What's Broken:** Any known issues
   - **Priority:** What should be worked on next

3. Ask: "What would you like to work on?"

## Important

- Do NOT skip any of the 4 files
- Do NOT assume you know the state - READ the files
- The STATUS.md file has the most recent information
- Proposals are Bill's #1 priority (not projects)
