# BENSLEY CONTENT STRATEGY 2025

**From:** Lukas Sherman
**To:** Bill Bensley, Brian Sherman
**Date:** December 2025
**Subject:** Content Strategy & Team Coordination Plan

---

Hi Bill,

Following our conversations about social media direction and the Bensley Brain, I've put together a comprehensive content strategy that consolidates everything we've discussed — your philosophy, the team structure, and how we're going to create content that actually matters.

The core shift: **We're moving from showcasing Bensley to teaching Bensley.**

Every piece of content should answer one question: *"What will someone learn from this that they'll remember in 5 years?"*

As you've said: *"If it doesn't serve the planet or its people, then why bother? Every project I do has to earn its keep — protect a forest, create jobs, tell a story that matters. Otherwise, I'm out."*

That's the standard we're holding all content to.

---

## THE THREE PILLARS

All content maps to these pillars from your philosophy:

### 1. Truth to Place
Nothing is designed "just because it looks good." Every decision is anchored in culture, climate, landscape, craft, and history. We start by visiting temples and heritage sites, reading deeply, speaking with locals — before we sketch.

*"With hotels, we have the wonderful opportunity to create an alternate universe for people."*

### 2. Sustainability & Stewardship
No greenwashing. Real impact. Two key mantras:
- **"Minimal Intervention"** — reading the lay of the land, building between or around trees rather than cutting them down
- **"High Yield, Low Impact"** — projects that give back more than they take

*"My dream is to build a hotel made of 100% recycled materials... How cool would that be?"*

### 3. Joyful Originality
*"Lebih gila, lebih baik — The crazier, the better. The odder, the better."*

The fantastical, theatrical elements that spark joy. No two Bensley properties are alike, yet the "Bensley vibe" is unmistakable: bold, witty, exuberant — and rigorously considered.

## THE TWO TRACKS

I've restructured the team to have clear ownership:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                        │
│    TRACK 1: AUBREY                    TRACK 2: BANI'S TEAM            │
│    In-House / Educational             Field / Narrative               │
│                                                                        │
│    Your knowledge & philosophy        Projects, people, stories       │
│    Carousels with video hooks         Reels on location               │
│    Recurring series format            Postcard Series + Quick Hits    │
│                                                                        │
│    "What Bill knows"                  "What Bensley creates"          │
│                                                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

# TRACK 1: AUBREY — Educational Series

**Owner:** Aubrey (in-house)
**Format:** Carousels with video/animation hooks
**Focus:** Your curated knowledge, design philosophy, recommendations

### The Problem with the Current Approach

Aubrey has been creating Reels that flip through 10+ items with captions — like the Science Fiction Books reel. While the content is great, **cramming 10 books into one video is too hard to follow**. You're skipping through so many different books with captions that it becomes overwhelming. No depth. Forgettable.

### The New Approach: Serialized Carousels with Depth

**Format Structure:**
- **Slides 1-2:** Engaging video or animation hook. Consistent visual identity so people recognize the series across posts.
- **Slides 3-4:** Your voiceover going deeper on **1-2 items only**. Real insight, not just a list.
- **Remaining slides:** Static with captions for context.
- **Repeat:** Next post continues the series (Books #3-4, etc.)

**Why this works:**
- Each post is digestible, not overwhelming
- Builds anticipation ("next week: more books")
- Creates a recognizable visual identity — when we post about it in the future, people connect and distinguish it
- Content library grows — this isn't one post, it's an ongoing series that can run for months
- We take the information you've already provided, focus on it, expand on it — content we can use for a long time

---

## YOUR FAVORITES — The Content Library

You've already provided rich commentary on your favorites. This is gold. Here's what we have:

### FAVORITE SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS

*"I love books. Books feed the imagination, ignite the passions and stir emotions. Books for me are an endless source of ideas, creativity and new insights."* — BIBLIO BILL, Bangkok 2025

| Book | Your Commentary |
|------|-----------------|
| **Parable of the Sower** — Octavia E. Butler | "I am inspired by Butler's vision of a dystopian future and the resilience of her protagonist. Her exploration of society, survival, and morality is both haunting and thought-provoking." |
| **Oryx and Crake trilogy** — Margaret Atwood | "I love Atwood's speculative worlds, where science, ethics, and human folly collide." |
| **The Three-Body Problem** — Cixin Liu | "Reading it feels like standing on the edge of the universe, pondering what might exist beyond our world." |
| **The Dark Forest** — Cixin Liu | "His storytelling is both epic and intimate, blending strategy, science, and philosophy." |
| **A Boy and His Dog at the End of the World** — C.A. Fletcher | "Reading it reminded me of the enduring strength of companionship in dire circumstances." |
| **The Handmaid's Tale** — Margaret Atwood | "**Atwood is my all-time favourite author.** My hair stood on end when the Church of Reform elders began hanging homosexuals." |
| **The Road** — Cormac McCarthy | "His prose is spare but powerful, evoking both despair and hope." |
| **The Hunger Games** — Suzanne Collins | "This is a ridiculous book, especially the characters of the Capitol." |
| **The Stand** — Stephen King | "I am not a huge fan of King's writing but The Stand was gorgeously sickening." |
| **One Second After** — William R. Forstchen | "I always imagine myself inside the story, often as the last survivor." |
| **Artemis** — Andy Weir | "Reading it is thrilling, fun, and makes me think about the possibilities of human innovation in space." |

**How we'll use this:** Don't post all 11 at once. Do 1-2 per carousel with your voiceover. Build the series over weeks.

### FAVORITE DESIGNERS

Your origin story — this is content gold:

> *"Design has been in my blood since my early days at school. A talk by landscape architect Rocco Campanozzi triggered the lightbulb moment for me. On my invitation, he visited my high school one afternoon with a spectacular slide show of his work at Knotts Berry Farm. I knew I had to be a landscape architect. I was smitten, hook line and sinker. I am still in touch with Rocco to this day and often thank him for his time some 42 years ago now.*
>
> *After studying at Cal Poly Pomona and Harvard I made that big leap across the Pacific to Asia in the early 1980s when hospitality development was in its infancy. One of my first major assignments was in Bali, working on hotel gardens. I quickly realised that hospitality design allowed for an extraordinary marriage of nature, narrative, and function — it wasn't just about plants or buildings, but about crafting entire experiences."*

**The Designers:**
David Collins, Geoffrey Bawa, Isamu Noguchi, Luis Barragan, Jaya Ibrahim, Frank Lloyd Wright, Antoni Gaudi, Michael Taylor, Ricardo Legoretta, Tony Duquette, Yabu + Pushelberg, Tony Chi, Ron Mann, Kit Kemp, Kelly Wearstler, Jeffrey Wilkes, John Saladino, Lek Bunnag, Jacques Garcia, Frank Gehry

**How we'll use this:** The origin story is a carousel on its own. Then do 1-2 designers per post with you explaining WHY they inspire you.

---

### FUTURE SERIES (to develop)

| Series | Content | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Favorite Hotels** | Non-Bensley hotels you admire | Need your input |
| **Favorite Artists** | Artists that inspire the work | Need list |
| **Design Philosophy** | "Why Black & White Works," "Layering Patterns" | Extract from interviews |
| **Constraint = Magic** | Design challenges that became features | Extract from project stories |

---

# TRACK 2: BANI'S TEAM — Narrative Storytelling

**Owner:** Bani and team (field production)
**Format:** Reels
**Focus:** Projects, people, process — the magic of Bensley in the real world

## Two Reel Types

### TYPE A: POSTCARD SERIES (Deep-Dive Projects)

In-depth storytelling about a specific Bensley project. The "Postcard" becomes a recognizable format — like a visual letter from each property.

**Blueprint:**
1. **The Challenge** — What was the site? What were the constraints?
2. **The Narrative** — What story did we create?
3. **The Journey** — Walk through the magic moments
4. **The Philosophy** — End with the lesson ("The constraint became the magic")

---

### THE SIAM POSTCARD

**The Origin Story:** You meet Mr. Sukosol while antique shopping. Friendship sparks. Suddenly the hotel becomes a living museum of his collections.

**The Constraint:** A narrow site near a busy road — but it goes into the river.

**The Solution:** Pocket spaces. Their own unique places that open up to another pocket to another pocket. You journey throughout all the antiques and antiquities collected by the owner.

**The Feeling:** It's like a museum, but not a museum where you feel like you can't touch something — it's very homey and comfortable. You walk through each space, culminating at the river.

---

### INTERCON KHAO YAI POSTCARD (January Shoot)

**The Narrative:** The life of Som Sak, the train conductor.

**The Concept:** We created the narrative of this hotel being a train station, following the life of a train conductor called Som Sak. All of the architecture, interiors, graphic design, signage, and storytelling is aligned to this one unique vision — connecting layout, typography, colors, and drawings with the narrative itself.

**What we'll capture:**
- Introduce Som Sak as a character
- Show how the narrative drives EVERYTHING: architecture, interiors, signage, colors, typography
- The Bensley full-service approach in action
- Viewers understand WHY it feels unified

---

### FUTURE POSTCARDS

| Project | The Story | The Philosophy |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Four Seasons Koh Samui** | "We kept all 856 coconut trees. The villas weave between them like they've always been there. You wake up to monkeys, not marble lobbies." | Minimal Intervention |
| **Capella Ubud** | Built around every tree. Zero trees cut. A 24-tent camp that "tip toes ever so softly on the land." | Constraint = Magic |
| **Shinta Mani Wild** | Zipline arrival. Guest stays fund anti-poaching rangers patrolling 350 hectares. Conservation wrapped in madcap fantasy. | Purpose-Driven Design |
| **Capella Hanoi** | French colonial style blended with Opera House theme. Every room has characters from the Opera. | Narrative Coherence |

---

### TYPE B: QUICK HITS (Team & Process)

Short, engaging Reels featuring real people sharing something interesting. Human, authentic, quick to produce.

**Current Deliverables:**

| Reel | Person | Topic | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| P'Mum boat | P'Mum | The boat story | In progress |
| Brian Siam walkthrough | Brian | Walking through The Siam | In progress |
| Office Gatsby party | Team | Year-end celebration | **Shoot: This Friday** |
| Aubrey talking about something | Aubrey | Process, something interesting | To shoot |

---

## GATSBY PARTY — This Friday

**What:** Office year-end party, Great Gatsby theme
**Challenge:** Keep it from becoming too whacky. Show the team signing off the year in style.
**Framing:** The team celebrating — elegant, fun, but fitting the Bensley tone.

---

# THE BENSLEY VOICE

**How you communicate:**

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Playful** | Design should bring joy | "The crazier, the better. The odder, the better." |
| **Confident** | Expert opinion stated directly | "I'm done with designing hotels just to put heads on beds." |
| **Story-driven** | Everything has narrative | Creating "Som Sak" with full backstory |
| **Purpose-driven** | Every project needs meaning | "Every project on our boards today has a purpose and a candle to light." |

**Voice Comparison:**

**Not this (generic luxury):**
> "The resort features 50 luxuriously appointed villas with stunning ocean views and world-class amenities."

**This (Bensley):**
> "We kept all 856 coconut trees at Four Seasons Koh Samui. The villas weave between them like they've always been there. You wake up to monkeys, not marble lobbies."

---

# QUOTABLE BILL — Ready for Content

**On Purpose:**
> "I'm done with designing hotels just to put heads on beds. Every project on our boards today has a purpose and a candle to light."

**On Creativity:**
> "The crazier, the better. The odder, the better."
> "If you can't draw with your hands, you won't be creative. The computer kills creativity."

**On Site Sensitivity:**
> "Minimal Intervention — reading the lay of the land."
> "At Four Seasons Koh Samui, we kept all 856 coconut trees intact. Now it's one of our trademark skills."

**On Sustainability:**
> "High Yield, Low Impact. We want projects that give back more than they take."

**On Hotels:**
> "With hotels, we have the wonderful opportunity to create an alternate universe for people."

---

# THE BENSLEY FULL-SERVICE APPROACH

Part of showcasing value is explaining what makes Bensley unique: we're a full-service design company. When you bring Bensley onto a project, you bring a design team that encompasses the entire scope:

- Interiors of bedrooms, F&B, lobby, pool areas
- Landscaping around the site
- Architectural façade design
- Master-planning
- Graphic signage
- Rich site research — visiting temples, learning culture and history

This coherence — one studio carrying landscape, architecture, interiors, staff uniforms, paintings, artwork, sculpture, antique procurement, even the salt and pepper shakers — is what creates uncommon unity in the final product.

**This is a content pillar.** Show it. Explain it. Make people understand WHY Bensley hotels feel different.

# ESCAPISM 3 CONNECTION

Everything we're building feeds into ESCAPISM 3 — the next book, which you've envisioned as more philosophical and design-thinking focused. Not just "look at these pretty hotels" but "here's how I think about design."

**Potential ESCAPISM 3 Content Pillars:**

1. **The Questions** — How you approach each project
   - What does this site want to be?
   - What story does this place tell?
   - Why does this matter beyond aesthetics?

2. **The Process** — From site visit to opening day
   - Reading the land
   - Finding the narrative
   - Hand-sketching vs. computer
   - Working with local craftspeople

3. **The Purpose** — Design with meaning
   - Conservation (Shinta Mani Wild)
   - Community (local craft, employment)
   - "High Yield, Low Impact"

4. **The Unexpected** — Case studies of bold choices
   - Train cars at InterContinental Khao Yai
   - Suspended tents at Shinta Mani Wild
   - 856 coconut trees at Four Seasons Koh Samui

**The Instagram content we're creating now becomes source material for ESCAPISM 3.**

# THE TEST

For every piece of content, ask:

**"Will someone remember this in 5 years? Will it change how they think about design?"**

If yes — publish.
If no — rethink.

---

# SUMMARY

| Track | Owner | Format | Focus |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Educational Series | Aubrey | Carousels with video hooks | Your knowledge, favorites, philosophy |
| Narrative Storytelling | Bani's Team | Reels | Projects (Postcard Series) + People (Quick Hits) |

**The shift:** From showcasing to teaching. From likes to lasting impact. From random posts to recognizable series.

**The key insight for Aubrey:** Don't cram 10 things into one video. Take your rich commentary, focus on 1-2 items per post, go deeper, and build a series over time.

**The key insight for Bani's team:** The Postcard Series is the theme. Every project gets the same treatment — start with the constraint, tell the narrative, walk through the magic, end with the philosophy.

**The goal:** When someone follows Bensley, they learn something. When they think of design, they think of your philosophy. When they see a Bensley property, they understand WHY it feels different.

Everything feeds into the bigger picture: Instagram today, ESCAPISM 3 tomorrow, the Bensley Bible forever.

Let me know your thoughts on the direction.

Lukas
